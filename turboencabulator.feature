Feature: Turboencabulator Operational Validation

  As an engineer tasked with validating the functionality of the Turboencabulator
  I want to ensure its key features and specifications align with the documented design
  So that I can confirm it meets operational and theoretical requirements

  Background:
    Given the Turboencabulator is installed in a testing environment
    And all connections to the unilateral phase detractors and cardinal grammeters are secured

  Scenario: Verify inverse reactive current supply
    When the Turboencabulator is activated
    Then it should supply inverse reactive current to the unilateral phase detractors
    And no deviation from the expected current waveform should be detected

  Scenario: Synchronize cardinal grammeters
    When the Turboencabulator is operating at nominal capacity
    Then it should automatically synchronize all attached cardinal grammeters
    And synchronization errors should be less than 0.001% variance

  Scenario: Modial interaction of magneto-reluctance and capacitive diractance
    Given the Turboencabulator is powered
    When the main winding is engaged
    Then power should be generated by modial interaction of magneto-reluctance and capacitive diractance
    And no side fumbling should be observed

  Scenario: Validate panametric fan operation
    Given the panametric fan is fitted with six hydrocoptic marzlevanes
    When the fan is rotated
    Then hydrocoptic marzlevanes should prevent side fumbling
    And all components should remain within tolerances for lunar waneshaft operation

  Scenario: Test forescent skor motion functionality
    Given forescent skor motion is required
    When the Turboencabulator is used with a drawn reciprocation dingle arm
    Then sinusoidal repleneration should be reduced by at least 50%

  Scenario: Validate differential girdle spring connection
    Given the main winding is a lotus-o-delta type
    And panendermic semi-boloid slots are properly aligned
    Then every seventh conductor should connect via a non-reversible tremie pipe to the differential girdle spring
    And the "up" end of the grammeters should receive consistent input

  Scenario: Assess novertrunnion operation
    When the Turboencabulator operates under standard conditions
    Then it should support novertrunnions without errors
    And no faults in operational stability should occur
